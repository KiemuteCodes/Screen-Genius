# Overview
This is a website that will deliver movies or shows to those who have seen everything. During COVID-19 our team has concluded this is a common problem amongst most people.
This website requires basic user input with genre selection buttons.
It will then use our two APIS;
<a href="https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction">The Movie Database Api</a>,
&
<a href="https://rapidapi.com/utelly/api/utelly">Rapid Api/Utelly</a>



The movies and shows displayed will only be titles that had a high viewer rating, and low viewer count "hidden gems".  These movies/shows will be randomized and portray a movie
 poster with an option to select more information, add to their watchlist, or rate the movie with a thumbs up or down. This information will be saved on local storage and will help to narrow down selections for the website to display. If a user selects more information, it will open a new page that shows where they can view it (selected streaming services with a link) and a trailer.
Implement an e petition system for those who would like to see a title on one streaming service be available on a different one such as Crave to Netflix. We could also implement an ‚Äúadd‚Äù system that would show an add every time the user refreshes the page or before it gives the user the movie options. Possibly create a paid version that would give the user 5 options no adds.
