# Overview
This website requires basic user input with genre selection buttons.
It will then use our two APIS;
<a href="https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction">The Movie Database Api</a>,
This api will pull from 100,000's movies based on one or a combination of multiple genres. We have narrowed down our search to the following parameters t set to pull movies with rating of 7 or higher, that has been voted on by more than 100 people, but less than a 1000. The reason behind this is we want to find the "hidden gems" of the entertainment industry. From this api we get the "TMDB ID" 
&

<a href="https://rapidapi.com/utelly/api/utelly">Rapid Api/Utelly</a> This api uses the "TMDB" Id to pull information about the title, we had to use the id as sometimes the title alone would not matchup to the first api call. By searching with ID we prevent any mishapps. This API gives us the streaming service that you can view this show or movie on. 




# Technologies
As we were limited by not usuing boot-strap we used;
* HTML

# Status
We are currently working on adding new features to Screen Genius! These feature include better suggested titles based on user input. 
A seperate e-petition page that will allow the user to request a streaming service to add a movie or show to their library.
